# üå≤ Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree
## üìö Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum path sum of any non-empty path. A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

### üìå Examples

- **Example 1**:
  - **Input**: `root = [1,2,3]`
  - **Output**: `6`
  - **Explanation**: The optimal path is `2 -> 1 -> 3` with a path sum of `2 + 1 + 3 = 6`.

- **Example 2**:
  - **Input**: `root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
  - **Output**: `42`
  - **Explanation**: The optimal path is `15 -> 20 -> 7` with a path sum of `15 + 20 + 7 = 42`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### üõ†Ô∏è Solution 1: Basic Approach

#### Approach:
1. **Tree Traversal** üå≤:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all paths starting from each node.
   - The function recursively calculates the maximum path sum for left and right subtrees.

2. **Path Sum Calculation** üßÆ:
   - At each node, calculate the maximum path sum including the node and its left and right children.
   - Consider paths that extend to the left, right, or both children.

3. **Recursive Function** üîÑ:
   - Calculates and returns the maximum path sum that can be extended to the parent node.
   - Updates the global maximum path sum.

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
- **`O(n)`**: Each node is visited once.

#### üß© Space Complexity:
- **`O(h)`**: Space used by the recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree.

### üõ†Ô∏è Solution 2: Optimized Approach

#### Approach:
1. **Enhanced Calculation** üîç:
   - Use DFS to compute maximum path sums while efficiently updating the global maximum path sum.
   - Only consider positive contributions from left and right subtrees.

2. **Global Variable** üåü:
   - Maintain a global variable to track the maximum path sum across all nodes.
   - Update this variable based on the maximum path sums including and extending from each node.

3. **Positive Contributions** ‚ûï:
   - Only positive path sums are considered to avoid reducing the overall path sum.

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
- **`O(n)`**: Each node is visited once.

#### üß© Space Complexity:
- **`O(h)`**: Space used by the recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree.
